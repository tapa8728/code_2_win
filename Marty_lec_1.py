'''
When you think about recursion, think about a bunch of small workers solving a larger problem

Eg - Find the total number of students in a column.
In this case, the workers are each of the students themselves. 
No for loops as we dont want one worker to do all the work, instead we want each worker to do its own work and help towards the final solution
